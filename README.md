Nodepong
========

Nodepong was a collaborative effort by [myself](http://github.com/trousyt), [moerion](http://github.com/moerion), and chorizo_omelette during the 2013 Node.js Bootcamp in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, our code was lost at the very end of the hackathon, but here's a close (and better) rendition.
